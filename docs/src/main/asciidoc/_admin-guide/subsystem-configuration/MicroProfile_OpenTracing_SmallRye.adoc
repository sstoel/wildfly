[[MicroProfile_OpenTracing_SmallRye]]
= MicroProfile OpenTracing Subsystem Configuration

Support for https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-opentracing[Eclipse MicroProfile OpenTracing] is
provided as a Tech Preview feature by the _microprofile-opentracing-smallrye_ subsystem.

== Required Extension

This extension is included in the standard configurations included in the WildFly distribution.

You can also add the extension to a configuration without it either by adding
an `<extension module="org.wildfly.extension.microprofile.opentracing-smallrye"/>`
element to the xml or by using the following CLI operation:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /extension=org.wildfly.extension.microprofile.opentracing-smallrye:add
{"outcome" => "success"}

[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=microprofile-opentracing-smallrye:add
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "response-headers" => {
        "operation-requires-reload" => true,
        "process-state" => "reload-required"
    }
}
----

== Supported instrumentation libraries

WildFly's MicroProfile OpenTracing subsystem implements MicroProfile 1.1, which includes support for tracing JAX-RS and
CDI.

Additionally, applications being deployed are able to provide their own tracers via the
https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-tracerresolver[`TracerResolver`] facility. In that case, the default tracer
will *not* be used.

The subsystem ships with https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-java[Jaeger Java Client] as the default tracer.
Refer to that project's documentation for instructions on how to configure it. Note that the configuration is only
possible by setting system properties or environment variables. If a more complex configuration is required, implement a
`TracerResolver` that returns the `Tracer` with the desired state.

WARNING: by default, the Jaeger Client Java has a probabilistic sampling strategy, set to 0.001, meaning that only
approximately one in one thousand traces will be sampled. To sample every request, set the environment variable
`JAEGER_SAMPLER_TYPE` to `const` and `JAEGER_SAMPLER_PARAM` to `1`.

WARNING: the supported configuration options for this Tech Preview feature, particularly those related to configuring
the Jaeger Java Client tracer, may change in incompatible ways in a future release.

By default, the service name used with the Jaeger Client is derived from the deployment's name, which is usually the
WAR file name.

As defined by the MicroProfile OpenTracing specification, CDI beans are traced if the annotation
`org.eclipse.microprofile.opentracing.Traced` is present, either at the type or method level. Tracing can be disabled
by setting the annotation's value to `false`. Similarly, a custom operation name can be set by specifying the parameter
`operationName` for that annotation. The semantics are ruled by the MicroProfile OpenTracing specification.

Note that CDI support for the deployment is required in order to activate the MicroProfile OpenTracing support. A simple
JAX-RS application with no CDI support will *not* be traced.

Managed beans with multiple facets, such as EJBs, can also be traced by annotating them with `@Traced`, but with
limitations. For instance, asynchronous invocations will yield a new trace, instead of having the span to join an
existing trace.
