[[required-extension-microprofile-health-smallrye]]
== Required Extension

This extension is included in the standalone configurations included in the
WildFly distribution.

You can also add the extension to a configuration without it either by adding
an `<extension module="org.wildfly.extension.microprofile.health-smallrye"/>`
element to the xml or by using the following CLI operation:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /]/extension=org.wildfly.extension.microprofile.health-smallrye:add
----

== Management Operation

The healthiness of the application server can be queried by calling the `check`:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=microprofile-health-smallrye:check
{
    "outcome" => "success", <1>
    "result" => {
        "outcome" => "UP", <2>
        "checks" => []
    }
}
----
<1> this `outcome` means that the management operation is successful
<2> this `outcome` corresponds to the health check, `UP` if the application server is healthy, `DOWN` else.

== HTTP Endpoint

The Health HTTP endpoint is accessible on WildFly HTTP management interface http://localhost:9990/health[http://localhost:9990/health].

Secured access to the HTTP endpoint is controlled by the `security-enabled` attribute of the `/subsystem=microprofile-health-smallrye` resource.
If it is set to `true`, the HTTP client must be authenticated.

If the application server is healthy, it will return a `200 OK` response:

---
$ curl -v http://localhost:9990/health
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
{"outcome":"UP","checks":[]}
---

If the application server (and its deployment) is not healthy, it returns `503 Service Unavailable`

----
$ curl -v http://localhost:9990/health
< HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
...
{"outcome":"DOWN","checks":[{"name":"myFailingProbe","state":"DOWN","data":{"foo":"bar"}}]}
----

If security has been enabled, the HTTP client must pass the credentials corresponding to a management user
created by the `add-user` script. For example:

---
$ curl -v --digest -u myadminuser:myadminpassword http://localhost:9990/health
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
{"outcome":"UP","checks":[]}
---

If the authentication fails, the  server will reply with a `401 NOT AUTHORIZED` response.
