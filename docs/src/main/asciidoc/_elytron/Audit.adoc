= Audit

WildFly Elytron supports audit using security event listeners - components
which captures security events, like successful or unsucceful login attempts.

== File audit log

File audit log logs security events into a local file.
It requires to define `path` to the log file, which can be `relative-to` a system property.
It also allows to set the file format - human readable `SIMPLE` or `JSON`.
While in WildFly 14 there was only one attribute `synchronized`, which had influence on data reliability, now there is possible more fine grained performance and reliability tunning:
* `autoflush` defines whether should be output stream flushed after every audit event (guarantees that the log message is passed to the operating system immediately)
* `synchonized` defines whether should be file descriptor synchronized after every audit event (guarantees that all system buffers are synchronized with the underlying device)
